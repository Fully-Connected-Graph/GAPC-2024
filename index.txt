8:Ta47,<h2>Welcome to the GAPC 2024 website!</h2>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Groningen Algorithmic Programming Contest (GAPC) is a 4 hour competitive programming contest, where students from (but not limited to) University of Groningen form teams of 1 to 3 people. The target is to solve the most problems and win the champion's cup.</p>
<p>The event will take place on the Saturday 29th of April in the Bernoulliborg, at the Study Landscape from 11:00 - 20:00. This is a full-day event, where not only the lunch and dinner will be provided, but also you'll have the chance to interact with our partner companies and feel the ICPC-style event vibe. More details about the schedule can be found <a href="/GAPC-2024/schedule/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Contest</h2>
<p>This contest is open to all students from a university within the Benelux region. Before registering, please read the rules of the contest and these can be found <a href="/GAPC-2024/rules/">here</a>. To participate, each team will need to bring their own laptop.</p>
<p>To solve the problems, you will be able to use Java, Python, C, C++ and Haskell. In the end, only the captain of the team needs to make the registration and it can be done <a href="/GAPC-2024/register/">here</a>.</p>

Fully Connected Graph (a.k.a. FCG) is a committee whose aim is to create an environment for students to challenge and improve their technical abilities.
<br/><br/>
In the present, our main focus is on events about competitive programming and machine learning, but we expect to extend our range of events in the next academic year.
