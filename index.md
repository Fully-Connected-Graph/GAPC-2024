## About

The Groningen Algorithmic Programming Contest (GAPC) is a 4 hour competitive programming contest, where students from (but not limited to) University of Groningen form teams of 1 to 3 people. The target is to solve the most problems and win the champion's cup.

The event will take place on the Saturday 29th of April in the Bernoulliborg, at the Study Landscape from 11:00 - 20:00. This is a full-day event, where not only the lunch and dinner will be provided, but also you'll have the chance to interact with our partner companies and feel the ICPC-style event vibe. More details about the schedule can be found [here](/GAPC-2024/schedule/).

## Contest

This contest is open to all students from a university within the Benelux region. Before registering, please read the rules of the contest and these can be found [here](/GAPC-2024/rules/). To participate, each team will need to bring their own laptop.

To solve the problems, you will be able to use Java, Python, C, C++ and Haskell. In the end, only the captain of the team needs to make the registration and it can be done [here](/GAPC-2024/register/).
